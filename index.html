      <p>
        My name is Daelan Hollingsworth, and I am from Pontotoc, MS. I went to
        South Pontotoc School, then I went to Base Camp Coding Academy in Water
        Valley, MS. Since I was small, I have always loved computers, games,
        music, and dabbled in coding here and there. I want to learn more when I
        get into a job, rather than just work with what I know.

      At Base Camp Coding Academy in Water Valley, we have done some projects.
      Some are terrific, whereas some crashed and burned. These are some of the
      better projects that I have either worked on by myself, or with others.

          This project was about who we thought was the GOAT, Greatest Of All
          Time. We completed this as a sign showing we know and understand basic
          html and css.

          This project was to make a made up charity. We demonstrated how we
          grew a little in css and html. In this project, we were not forced to
          use multiple html pages, but for the sake of my mind, I did.

          This project was a personal project on replit. It helps the management
          team with inventory. It keeps track of the item, quantity, any notes
          someone put with it, and the date that it was last ordered.

          This project was to let our directors know that we understand all that
          we were taught upto that point. It was not required, but if you had
          finished the rest of the module work the week before, you did the unit
          project. This was a fun adventure based game that I helped on. Jacen
          Barefoot and I worked hard on it, and in the end, it worked out fine.

          This is another CRUD app that we had to finish. This one, however, is
          fixed so that it will remember the password, username, website, and
          whether or not it was a favorite from past uses. Until it is deleted,
          it should remember all of the items.
